    <string name="ABT_BHM">Your brush head wears out and loses performance depending on the type of brush, the amount of pressure applied while brushing and how long you have been brushing.\n\nOver months of normal use, brush heads gradually wear down and lose their stiffness. For the best results it’s important to replace at least every 3 months.\n\nA smart algorithm, combines data from the sensors and the Smartlink chip in the brush head.  This app gives you accurate and personalized brush head replacement reminders based on an algorithm.\n\nBut now you can get smarter about this! dsa</string>
